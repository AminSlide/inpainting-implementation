# üñºÔ∏è Image Inpainting with Criminisi‚Äôs Algorithm

This repository provides a Python implementation of **exemplar-based image inpainting** using the algorithm described by Criminisi et al. in their paper:

## üìå Objective

The goal is to reconstruct missing regions in an image (defined by a binary mask) by filling them with similar patches from the known region, following a mathematically defined priority mechanism.

---

## üß† Mathematical Overview

The algorithm fills pixels along the boundary of the target region by computing a **priority score** for each pixel `p`:

### Priority Function

    P(p) = C(p) * D(p)

Where:
- `C(p)`: Confidence term
- `D(p)`: Data term (structure propagation)

### 1. Confidence Term `C(p)`

Measures how much of the patch around pixel `p` is already known:

    C(p) = (1 / |Œ®_p|) * ‚àë_{q ‚àà Œ®_p ‚à© Œ©^c} C(q)

- `Œ©^c`: known (source) region  
- `|Œ®_p|`: size of patch centered at `p`

### 2. Data Term `D(p)`

Encourages the continuation of strong image structures (isophotes) into the missing region:

    D(p) = |‚àáI‚ä•_p ‚ãÖ n_p| / Œ±

- `‚àáI‚ä•_p`: isophote at point `p` (direction orthogonal to gradient)  
- `n_p`: boundary normal at `p`  
- `Œ±`: normalizing constant (e.g., 255)

### 3. Patch Matching

Once the pixel with highest priority is chosen, its patch `Œ®_p` is filled by copying pixels from the best matching source patch `Œ®_q`:

    Œ®_q = argmin_{Œ®_r ‚àà Œ©^c} SSD(Œ®_p, Œ®_r)

Only known pixels are used in the SSD (Sum of Squared Differences) computation.

## üîÅ Algorithm Steps

1. Identify the boundary of the masked region.
2. Compute `P(p)` for all boundary pixels.
3. Select the patch `Œ®_p` with highest priority.
4. Search for best matching patch `Œ®_q` in the known region.
5. Copy known pixels from `Œ®_q` into the unknown area of `Œ®_p`.
6. Update the mask and confidence map.
7. Repeat until the region is fully filled.
