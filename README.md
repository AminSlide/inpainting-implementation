# üñºÔ∏è Image Inpainting with Criminisi‚Äôs Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the exemplar-based inpainting algorithm described by Criminisi et al. in their 2004 paper:
Here is the result I achieved with my implementation: the camera branch was successfully removed.

## üìå Objective

The goal is to reconstruct missing regions of an image (defined by a binary mask) by copying the most relevant patches from the known region. The algorithm follows a priority-based filling strategy, which favors areas where image structures (like edges or textures) are most likely to continue smoothly.

---

## üß† Mathematical Overview

At each iteration, the algorithm selects the **most promising patch** to inpaint based on a **priority function** defined for every pixel `p` on the boundary of the target region:

### Priority Function

    P(p) = C(p) * D(p)

Where:
- `P(p)`: Priority of the patch centered at pixel `p`
- `C(p)`: Confidence term ‚Äî represents the reliability of surrounding pixels
- `D(p)`: Data term ‚Äî promotes the continuation of strong image structures (isophotes)

---

## üî∑ 1. Confidence Term `C(p)`

This term reflects how much of the patch `Œ®_p` around pixel `p` is already known. It is calculated as the **average confidence of the known pixels within the patch**:

    C(p) = (1 / |Œ®_p|) * Œ£ C(q), for all q in Œ®_p ‚à© Œ©^c

Where:
- `Œ®_p` is the square patch centered at pixel `p`
- `Œ©^c` is the known (source) region of the image
- `|Œ®_p|` is the total number of pixels in the patch
- `C(q)` is the confidence value of pixel `q` (initially 1 for known pixels, 0 for unknown)

üß† This term ensures that the algorithm prefers to fill patches that are **well surrounded by known pixels**.

---

## üî∑ 2. Data Term `D(p)`

This term encourages the propagation of linear structures like edges into the missing region. It is computed using the **dot product between the isophote direction and the boundary normal** at `p`:

    D(p) = |‚àáI‚ä•(p) ‚ãÖ n(p)| / Œ±

Where:
- `‚àáI‚ä•(p)` is the isophote at point `p`, i.e., the direction perpendicular to the image gradient
- `n(p)` is the **unit normal vector** to the boundary of the missing region at `p`
- `Œ±` is a normalization constant (typically 255)

üìà The **data term is maximal** when the isophote direction is **aligned with the normal vector**, i.e., when the structure points directly into the hole. This prioritizes pixels where edges are likely to **continue naturally**.

---

## üî∑ 3. Patch Matching (Exemplar Search)

Once the pixel `p*` with highest priority is chosen, the algorithm finds the **most similar source patch** `Œ®_q` in the known region using **Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)**, computed only over known pixels:

### SSD Formula

    SSD(Œ®_p, Œ®_q) = Œ£ [I_p(i) - I_q(i)]¬≤, for all i ‚àà K

Where:
- `I_p(i)` and `I_q(i)` are the intensities at pixel `i` in patches `Œ®_p` and `Œ®_q`, respectively
- `K` is the set of **known pixels** in `Œ®_p` (unknown pixels are ignored)

### Patch Selection

    Œ®_q = argmin_{Œ®_r ‚àà Œ©^c} SSD(Œ®_p, Œ®_r)

This means: the algorithm searches over all candidate patches `Œ®_r` fully contained in the known region `Œ©^c`, and selects the one that minimizes the SSD with `Œ®_p`. Only the pixels in `Œ®_p` that are known (not masked) are used in the comparison.

üéØ The selected source patch `Œ®_q` is then used to copy pixel values into the unknown parts of `Œ®_p`.

## üîÅ Algorithm Steps

1. Detect the boundary (`‚àÇŒ©`) of the target region (the hole).
2. For each boundary pixel `p`:
    - Compute the confidence term `C(p)`
    - Compute the data term `D(p)`
    - Compute the priority `P(p) = C(p) * D(p)`
3. Choose the patch centered at `p*` with the **highest priority**.
4. Search for the best matching patch in the known region using SSD.
5. Copy pixels from the source patch to the unknown pixels.
6. Update the mask and confidence map.
7. Repeat until all missing pixels are filled.
